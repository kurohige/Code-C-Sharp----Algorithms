# Code-C-Sharp----Algorithms
The purpose of this report was to store all of the code that I was able to go through when learning C# by following the Linkedin/Learning courses that are part of the 
Certificate of complation for the "Becoming a C# developer". 
I've really enjoyed this past courses and plan to do/add more code related to C# in here.
Now, onto design patterns!
